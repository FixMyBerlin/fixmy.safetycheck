  "02_intro.p1": "Until now, very little was known about which types of street configurations, cycle infrastructure and junctions are found to be safest from the perspective of the citizens travelling through those systems. Even less was known about how different street characteristics alter this perception of safety - characteristics such as the design, width and position of a cycle path or the setup either side of said route. Are cycle paths with protective bollards the best solution to reduce the palpable conflict between motor and cycle traffic, or is the width of the cycle path the deciding factor? What effect does the colour of the cycle path have? Which conditions help cyclists to feel their safest when the cycle path is on the pavement or on the road?",
  "02_intro.p2.link": "“Survey concept”",
  "02_intro.p2": "To close this gap in our knowledge, we developed a survey entitled “Straßencheck” (‘Street Check-up’) and carried out the survey in cooperation with the Berlin Tagesspiegel (a mainstream newspaper).  21,000 participants rated 1900 variations of common street configurations as illustrated with 3D imagery. The fundamental structure of the survey (see {link}) involved categorising various street configurations and their differing characteristics. This allowed us to analyse the extent to which individual characteristics - such as cycle path width, path surface, physical barriers, parking on the right side of the cycle path etc - make a difference. We were also able to gain insights into how the perceived sense of safety differs between different groups of road users and from the perspective of both motorists and pedestrians.\n",
  "02_intro.p3": "When a cycle route is implemented along the road, cyclists feel safest with the street configuration shown in the left image above, compared to all other variations. Motorists prefer almost exactly the same configuration but without the green colouring. The wide, green-coloured cycle path, separated from the motor traffic by planters, received the most ‘safe’ ratings (83.93%) and ‘mostly safe’ ratings (15.18%). On average, however, cycle paths running along the pavement were felt to be safer than those running next to moving traffic. Routes along minor roads and side streets were perceived to be extremely unsafe if the street was not marked as ‘car-free’. Detailed analysis of the different types of cycle paths and their influencing factors, including from the perspective of motorists and pedestrians, will be presented in the statistical evaluation section of this report.",

The scenes could be rated on a four-point scale from ‘unsafe’, ‘rather unsafe’, ‘rather safe’ to ‘safe’. Finally the participant could choose whether they wished to rate more scenarios or change to the perspective of a different road user (i.e. from cyclist to motorist etc). After another ten scenarios, the participant was given the same option again. The survey could thus be continued as long as the participant wished. On average, each participant rated 22 scenarios.",

  "03_concept.p2": "While the objective safety of cyclists has already been investigated in multiple studies, scarcely any research has been carried out on perceived/subjective safety. The particular challenge when investigating subjective safety is to collect enough ratings for various street configurations and simultaneously look into each of the many different influences on the perceived safety of a situation in enough detail. It was therefore necessary to illustrate a wide variety of different street configurations in the survey and at the same time reach a large number of participants via an effective communication strategy.",

  "03_concept.p3": "It is typically difficult to determine how narrow a cycle path has to be for it to be considered ‘too narrow’ simply with qualitative surveys of cyclists’ opinions. This is also the case when gauging the subjective perception of street traffic scenarios or combinations of specific structural characteristics (such as narrow cycle paths or parking spaces). Furthermore, these kinds of surveys are usually carried out with participants who generally travel by bike on a regular basis. This means that the resulting data often only represents the ‘cyclist’ demographic.",
  "03_concept.p4": "By working with images of specific street scenarios, the survey was able to show direct connections between the subjective perception of safety with regards to different types of infrastructure and their various structural characteristics. By collecting data about participants’ modes of transport plus demographic data we were able to sort the data about perceived safety into different social and mobility demographics (e.g. motorists, cyclists etc). Thanks to the large number of participants and the communications strategy we developed with the Berlin Tagesspiegel we were able to survey a large number and diverse spread (across various social and mobility demographics) of people.",
  "03_concept.p5": "When choosing the scenarios in the survey it was important to reflect cycle path variants which are currently in use. After close consultation with Berlin’s senate administration, thematic workshops, an intensive review of current research in the relevant literature and after pulling in new infrastructure concepts, we felt confident that the survey was up-to-date. For example, Berlin’s senate administration is currently particularly interested in road users’ opinions on different kinds of barriers (bollards/posts) due to the plans they currently have in the pipeline.",

For the launch, a front-page article was additionally published in the print edition of the newspaper which made readers aware of the survey. Although the main purpose of the survey was to evaluate various types of cycle infrastructure as per the subjective sense of safety, the survey was neutrally portrayed as a ‘Berlin Street Check’. This enabled us to bring in, among others, over 3,500 participants who said they never travelled by bike.",

  "03_concept.p9.heading": "Questions about the individual",
  "03_concept.p9": "These questions were designed to allow us to sort the participants into different types of cyclists/non-cyclists. This enabled us to better understand the answers provided by participants when giving their subjective safety ratings. These divisions were based on the work of Francke, Anke and Lißner (2019). In their assessment, they propose a taxonomy of cyclists/non-cyclists, which they use to describe various preferences road users have for cycle infrastructure. The questionnaire used in their study was extremely thorough; since our focus was rather to collect data on the safety ratings of street scenarios, we therefore reduced the questionnaire down to the most important elements. By changing the questionnaire the results of the two studies are therefore admittedly not directly comparable (see Schwarz, 1999 and Catania et al., 1996), but this was felt to be the right decision in light of the main goal of our survey. Alongside collecting the participant’s sociodemographic data (age, gender, place of residence, number of children), the survey also included questions about their transport behaviour - in particular, whether and to what extent the person travelled by bike.",

Which traffic infrastructure is felt to be safe by the majority of participants? Is the width of a cycle path or a physical divide alongside it a deciding factor?

To this end, an online survey was developed, in which participants rated photorealistic visualisations of street configurations by their sense of perceived safety from the perspective of different modes of travel. In this way we were able to measure the influences of different street characteristics and analyse these data, although many other influencing factors were identified which would be required to reach a complete understanding of how various scenarios are perceived in real life.In cooperation with a Berlin-based daily newspaper, we were able to reach a large number of participants. Roughly 90% of the participants were based in Berlin. Additionally, certain demographic groups were overrepresented in the survey: namely men, those in the age group 30 to 64, and cyclists. However, the large total number of participants meant that the amount of data collected for the underrepresented groups was also sufficient.In an initial analysis of the survey, the influence of various factors in relation to each other showed that it was not possible to draw any linear conclusions about subjective safety in cycle infrastructure design. It was nonetheless possible to extract several core conclusions and overall recommendations about how a “cycle infrastructure for everyone” could look.",

In this case it is however important to bear in mind that other potential tensions on such roads, such as illegally parked cars or reverse-parking vehicles, were not included in the visualisations for the survey.
