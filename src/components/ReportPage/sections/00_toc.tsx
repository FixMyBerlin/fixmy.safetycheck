  We could make this more fancyâ€¦
  Here are few good articles.
  - https://blog.openreplay.com/creating-a-table-of-content-widget-in-react
    (and the full code https://codesandbox.io/s/infallible-borg-mqh9df?file=/src/App.tsx:877-963)
    This does not represent highrarcy well, it just intend the second level a bit more.
    Which is OK, since ATM we only have one level.
    Gotcha: The getId method does not work. And a renderToString from react-dom/server does not work with Intl well.
    However, we can just set the ids manually, I guess.

    Handles the highrarchy better.
  - https://blog.eyas.sh/2022/03/react-toc/#user-content-fn-1
    Looks OK as well.
  - And then there is the version that is usedin fixmy-frontend.
    Which derives the TOC by iterating over children AFAIK. Which IMO is more complexity than we need;
    he solutions above all just use a querySelector.
